### A deterministic *Taenia solium* and Cysticercosis dynamic model


-----
  
### Overview
A deterministic, compartmental model of the Cysticercosis disease system.

For full model details please see:

> Winskill, P., Harrison, W.E., French, M. D., Dixon, M., Abela-Ridder, B. & Basáñez, M.-G. (2017) Assessing the impact of intervention strategies against Taenia solium cysticercosis using the epicyst transmission model. Parasites & Vectors, 10:73, DOI: 10.1186/s13071-017-1988-9

Available at:

[Parasites and Vectors] (https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-017-1988-9).
