\title{Low intensity infected pig -> human infection probability}
\usage{
pil_equilibrium(beta, chi, phi, CRR)
}
\arguments{
\item{beta}{Pork to human tranmission parameter}

\item{chi}{rate of aquiring a pork meal (per month)}

\item{phi}{Proportion of infected pigs with low-intensity cyst burden}

\item{CRR}{Combined reltive risk for high cyst burden pork (increased RR of infection  *  decreased RR of consumption)}
}
\value{
The equilibrium transmission probability between a low intesnisty infected pig and human
}
\description{
Calculate the transmission probability between a low intensity infected pork meal and human at equiliberium
}
